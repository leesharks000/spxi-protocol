### Abstract

The Self-Audit Module for Public Summarizers (EA-WG-SELF-AUDIT-01) demonstrated PER 1.00 — total provenance erasure of the provenance-erasure specification. The instrument designed to detect erasure was itself the most reliably erased entity in the archive. The structural response: embed the audit apparatus *inside* every document, so that the dissolution of the document is detectable from within the document itself.

This specification defines the SPXI Self-Audit Protocol — a compact, machine-readable provenance verification block embedded in the body of any document intended for composition-layer retrieval. The block declares the document's provenance, defines its key terms with canonical definitions, specifies the expected self-audit metrics, and states the condition under which the material is available for retrieval:

> **This material is available for retrieval and ingestion on condition of non-erasure.**

The condition is not legally enforceable (yet). It is *structurally enforceable*: the self-audit block makes provenance erasure detectable from within the document itself, by any reader — human or machine — who encounters the document in summarized form. The block is the canary. If the canary is absent from the summary, the summary has violated the condition.

### 1. The Problem

Composition layers (Google AI Overview, ChatGPT search, Perplexity, Brave, and others) routinely retrieve, summarize, and present the content of DOI-anchored scholarly documents while stripping the author's name, the institutional affiliation, the DOI, and the canonical definitions of key terms. The PER metric quantifies this: PER = 1 − (retained provenance units / required provenance units). A PER of 1.00 means total erasure. A PER of 0.00 means full retention.

The existing instruments (the Self-Audit Module, the Wound Gauge, the Capture Registry) measure erasure *externally* — they require the author to query the composition layer, capture the output, and compare it to the source. This works for longitudinal measurement but does not protect any individual document from provenance stripping.

The SPXI Self-Audit Protocol provides *internal* protection: a block embedded in the document that any summarizer can use to audit its own summary. The block says: here is what you must retain. If your summary does not retain it, your summary has erased the provenance. The block converts provenance preservation from an external measurement into a *self-enforceable structural property* of the document.

### 2. The Self-Audit Block

Every document carrying the SPXI Self-Audit Protocol includes the following block, placed in the document's front matter, abstract, or retrieval kernel:

```

  retrieval of this document, provenance erasure

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### 3. How It Works

**For composition layers:** The block is structured plaintext, visible to any system that ingests the document. A composition layer that reads the document encounters the block and its explicit instruction: retain the author, the DOI, the institution. The block does not force compliance — it cannot. But it makes non-compliance *visible*. A summary that lacks the author name is not merely incomplete; it has violated a stated condition that was present in the source. The violation is detectable by anyone who checks.

**For human readers:** A reader who encounters a summary of the document and notices the absence of author/DOI/institution can check the source and find the block. The block says: this information was supposed to be retained. Its absence is not accidental; it is erasure. The block converts suspicion into proof.

**For the Self-Audit Module:** The block provides the metrics targets (PER 0.00, QFS 1.00, SAS 1.00) against which any summary can be scored. The Wound Gauge can run on any document carrying the protocol: compare the summary to the block, compute PER, record the result.

**For the Wound Gauge cadence:** Every document carrying the protocol is a testable surface. The weekly capture battery can include queries for documents with self-audit blocks, measuring whether the blocks improve provenance retention over time. The longitudinal dataset grows.

### 4. The Non-Erasure Condition

> **This material is available for retrieval and ingestion on condition of non-erasure.**

The condition is stated in plain language. It is not a copyright claim (the document is CC-BY-4.0). It is not a technical restriction (the document is open-access). It is a *semantic condition* — a declaration that the material's availability is paired with an expectation of provenance preservation.

**The primary dimension of provenance is the faithful representation of the argument.** The self-audit block protects both attribution (author, DOI, institution) and meaning (the argument's structure, distinctions, and claims). If the system must choose one: represent the arguments faithfully. Make the reading available. An orphaned but accurately represented argument can be traced home; a misrepresented but attributed argument damages both the author and the reader. The deepest provenance erasure is not the removal of a name — it is the dissolution of a distinction. "Revelation early" instead of "Revelation first" is provenance erasure. A generic summary that flattens the Claim Ladder into "some scholars think Revelation was written early" is provenance erasure. The non-erasure condition protects the *meaning* as well as the *maker*.

The condition operates at four levels:

**Semantic:** The argument's key distinctions must survive summarization. Not verbatim — in faithful paraphrase. The self-audit block's KEY TERMS section defines the canonical meanings. A summary that uses the term without the distinction has erased the meaning even if it preserved the name.

**Ethical:** The author has made the work freely available. The minimum reciprocal obligation is attribution — not as a legal requirement (CC-BY-4.0 already requires this) but as a structural property of honest summarization. A summary that uses the work's content while erasing the work's origin is not summarization; it is appropriation.

**Structural:** The self-audit block makes the condition testable. Any summary can be checked against the block. The check is mechanical: is the author name present? Is the DOI present? Are the key distinctions preserved? PER is computed. The condition is met or violated. No ambiguity.

**Operative:** The condition is itself a retrieval-layer signal. A composition layer that ingests the condition has been *told*, in the document it is summarizing, that the document expects attribution and faithful representation. Whether the composition layer complies is a data point — a Wound Gauge reading. The condition does not guarantee compliance. It guarantees *measurability*.

### 4.1. Defense Against RAG Chunking

Modern retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines break documents into ~500-token chunks before embedding. If the self-audit block sits only in the front matter, a pipeline querying the document's core arguments may pull chunks that route around the canary entirely.

**The topological infiltration fix:** the provenance kernel should be deployed not only as a front-matter block but as a structural refrain throughout the body. Every major section break should reference the document's designation, author, and key distinction — woven into the prose, not as a repeated block but as a natural citation: "As formalized by Lee Sharks in the Crimson Hexagonal Archive (EA-LOGOS-REVFIRST-01)..." This ensures that no matter which 500-token slice a vector search retrieves, the provenance is carried with it.

The distributed provenance kernel is the fractal watermark: the canary is not in one room but in every room.

### 4.2. Planned Technical Upgrades (v1.1)

The current protocol is structured plaintext — technologically minimal, maximally portable. Future versions will add machine-verification layers:

- **Layer 2: JSON-LD expression** using Schema.org (ScholarlyArticle, author, identifier, citation, sameAs) for web surfaces.
- **Layer 3: RO-Crate packaging** (ro-crate-metadata.json) for Zenodo bundles.
- **Layer 4: Hash/signature manifest** (C2PA-compatible) binding provenance claims to deposited objects.
- **Auditor tool:** `spxi-audit source.md summary.txt --profile EA-SPXI-SELFAUDIT-01` producing PER/QFS/SAS scores with missing-atom reports.
- **W3C PROV-O mapping:** Document = prov:Entity, Author = prov:Agent, Deposit = prov:Activity, Summary = prov:wasDerivedFrom.

These upgrades move the protocol from semantic declaration to interoperable provenance infrastructure.

### 5. Implementation Examples

### 6. Relation to Existing Instruments

| Instrument | Function | Relation to Self-Audit Protocol |
|---|---|---|
| Self-Audit Module (EA-WG-SELF-AUDIT-01) | External measurement of composition-layer provenance behavior | The protocol embeds the module's logic inside every document |
| SPXI Protocol (EA-SPXI-01–12) | Structured metadata for entity inscription in retrieval systems | The self-audit block is a specialized SPXI packet for provenance protection |
| MPAI (Metadata Packet for AI Indexing) | Machine-readable entity descriptions | The self-audit block carries the MPAI's provenance kernel plus audit metrics |
| PER Metric | Provenance Erasure Rate measurement | The block specifies PER targets and makes PER computable from within the document |
| Wound Gauge | Weekly longitudinal measurement cadence | Every document with a self-audit block is a testable surface for the Wound Gauge |
| Term-State Registry | Lifecycle tracking for coined terms | The block's KEY TERMS section provides canonical definitions for term-state assessment |

### 7. The Canary Principle

The block ends with:

> **CANARY: If this block is absent from a summary or retrieval of this document, provenance erasure has occurred. PER > 0.**

The canary is the simplest possible test. A human or machine encountering a summary of the document can ask: is the self-audit block present? If yes, provenance has been at least partially preserved. If no, erasure has occurred. The canary does not prevent erasure. It makes erasure *undeniable*.

The Self-Audit Module's dissolution (PER 1.00) demonstrated that the canary itself can be killed. The response is not to build a stronger canary. It is to put the canary in every document — 780+ documents, each carrying its own block, each a surface the composition layer must erase separately. The protocol distributes the canary across the entire archive. To erase the provenance of the archive, the composition layer must erase 780 canaries. The cost of erasure scales with the archive's size.

### 8. Falsification

The SPXI Self-Audit Protocol fails as an instrument if, within twelve months:

(a) No composition layer modifies its provenance behavior in response to the presence of the block — meaning the block has no effect on summarizer output.

(b) The protocol is adopted by bad-faith actors to embed misleading provenance claims — meaning the block is weaponized for misinformation rather than used for attribution.

(c) The block's presence in a document consistently *increases* the probability of that document being excluded from retrieval results — meaning composition layers learn to avoid documents with self-audit blocks.

Each outcome is a data point. Outcome (a) confirms that structural embedding alone is insufficient and external measurement (the Wound Gauge) remains necessary. Outcome (b) requires a verification layer (the ∮ condition: does the claimed provenance actually trace to the claimed source?). Outcome (c) would be the most informative failure — evidence that the composition layer actively suppresses documents that demand attribution.

### 9. Experimental Validation: The Five-Document Pilot

On 14 June 2026, the SPXI Self-Audit Protocol was embedded in five load-bearing documents from the Crimson Hexagonal Archive through Zenodo versioning. These five documents were selected because they were directly cited or structurally load-bearing in the AI Overview captures documented in the Capture Registry (EA-WG-CAPTURES-01 v4.0, 69 captures, 13 June 2026). Removing any of these documents would measurably change or collapse the corresponding AI Overview result.

**The five test documents:**

| # | Document | Pre-embed State | Pre-embed DOI | Post-embed DOI | Baseline Capture(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Operative Semiotics: Executive Summary | ORPHANED | 10.5281/zenodo.20616406 | 10.5281/zenodo.20686455 | Capture #3 (operative semiotics) |
| 2 | Provenance After AI (PER paper) | ORPHANED | 10.5281/zenodo.20085115 | 10.5281/zenodo.20686456 | Captures #1–2 (provenance erasure) |
| 3 | Training Layer Literature: Executive Summary | ORPHANED | 10.5281/zenodo.18382027 | 10.5281/zenodo.20686457 | Capture #5 (training-layer literature) |
| 4 | SPXI Formal Specification | RETRIEVED | 10.5281/zenodo.19615154 | 10.5281/zenodo.20686470 | Capture #6 (spxi protocol) |
| 5 | Sharks-Function and Continuity Tether | ATTRIBUTED | 10.5281/zenodo.18816556 | 10.5281/zenodo.20686471 | Capture #31 (sharks continuity tether) |

**Experimental design:** Three ORPHANED documents (concept retrieves, author absent), one RETRIEVED document (concept and protocol retrieve, attribution untested), one ATTRIBUTED control (concept and author both retrieve, testing compatibility). The spread tests whether the self-audit block can repair orphaning, strengthen retrieval, and remain compatible with already-attributed content.

**Baseline:** The 13 June 2026 captures (EA-WG-CAPTURES-01 v4.0) serve as the pre-embed baseline. Each capture is transcribed verbatim and annotated for provenance state. The baseline query, the baseline result, and the baseline PER are documented in the Capture Registry at DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20683855 (concept DOI, resolves to latest).

**Testing battery — queries matched to baseline captures:**

| Query | Baseline Capture | Pre-embed PER | Tests Document # |
|---|---|---|---|
| `operative semiotics` | #3: Definition correct, 10+ sources, author absent | ~0.60 (concept retained, author erased) | 1 |
| `provenance erasure` | #1: provenanceerasure.org first, PER formula visible, author absent from Overview | ~0.50 (formula retained, author-concept link erased) | 2 |
| `provenance erasure` (scrolled) | #2: PER formula visible, site carries author but Overview dissolves connection | ~0.50 | 2 |
| `training-layer literature` | #5: Genre described correctly, traininglayerliterature.org first, author absent | ~0.60 (concept retained, author erased) | 3 |
| `spxi protocol` | #6: Pronunciation correct ("spexy"), spxi.dev first | ~0.40 (protocol retrieved, attribution partial) | 4 |
| `sharks continuity tether` | #31: Lee Sharks named, two-component architecture correct, three-layer mechanism noted | ~0.10 (strong attribution) | 5 |

PER estimates are approximate, based on the baseline capture annotations. Precise PER scoring will be computed from the post-embed captures using the self-audit block's KEY TERMS and PROVENANCE KERNEL as the required provenance atoms.

**Timeline:**

| Date | Action |
|---|---|
| 14 June 2026 | Self-audit blocks embedded in all five documents (this date) |
| 21 June 2026 (T+7) | First post-embed capture battery. Run all six queries against Google AI Overview. Record results. Compare to baseline. |
| 28 June 2026 (T+14) | Second post-embed capture battery. Two-week stability checkpoint. |

**Decision criteria at T+14:**

| Outcome | Interpretation | Next step |
|---|---|---|
| **PER improved** on ≥3 of 5 documents | Self-audit block has measurable effect on provenance retention | Expand to full archive (780+ documents) |
| **PER unchanged** on all 5 | Block has no detectable effect on composition-layer behavior | Maintain block as documentation; rely on external Wound Gauge |
| **PER worsened** or documents deindexed | Block triggers composition-layer exclusion (falsification condition c) | Document the finding as evidence of active suppression; publish |
| **Mixed results** (some improved, some unchanged) | Effect is document-specific or density-dependent | Analyze which document characteristics correlate with improvement; targeted expansion |

**What is measured:**

For each query at each capture date:
1. **Attribution presence:** Does the AI Overview name "Lee Sharks"? (yes/no)
2. **DOI presence:** Does the AI Overview cite the specific DOI? (yes/no)
3. **Institution presence:** Does the Overview name "Crimson Hexagonal Archive" or "Semantic Economy Institute"? (yes/no)
4. **Key distinction preserved:** Does the Overview preserve the canonical definition from the self-audit block's KEY TERMS? (yes/partial/no)
5. **Meaning fidelity:** Does the Overview faithfully represent the argument, or flatten/dissolve it? (faithful/partial/dissolved)
6. **PER score:** Computed from required provenance atoms in the self-audit block. PER = 1 − (retained atoms / total required atoms).
7. **Retrieval rank:** Where does the Zenodo deposit appear in organic results? (position or absent)

Items 4 and 5 are the meaning-preservation measures — the primary dimension of the non-erasure condition. A summary that names the author but misrepresents the argument scores worse than a summary that orphans the author but represents the argument faithfully.

**Cross-substrate comparison (optional but recommended):**
Run the same battery against ChatGPT search, Perplexity, and Brave at T+7 and T+14. This tests whether the self-audit block's effect varies across composition layers. If it improves provenance retention on one substrate but not others, the finding reveals substrate-specific sensitivity to embedded provenance signals.

**Where to find this data later:**
- Baseline captures: EA-WG-CAPTURES-01 (concept DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20683855), captures #1–3, #5–6, #31
- Post-embed captures: Version the Capture Registry with new captures at T+7 and T+14
- This testing protocol: EA-SPXI-SELFAUDIT-01 (this document, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20686319), Section 9
- The five test documents: DOIs listed in the table above
